When running the analysis for one variable, we systematically obtain the results of the other column and the other way around. The Stata code provided in the replication package outputs the same results as our package.\nThe coefficient we obtain for age in the first period is -3.277 and not -0.277 as featured in the paper. We believe it is a typo in the paper since the number of observations, standard errors, optimal polynomial value and p-value we obtain are the same as reported in the paper.
