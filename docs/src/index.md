# Table3Landais

Documentation for [Table3Landais](https://github.com/ElvinLP/Table3Landais.jl).

The package Table3Landais was designed to replicate using Julia Table nÂ°3 from Camille Landais' paper ["Assessing the Welfare Effects of Unemployment Benefits Using the Regression Kink Design"](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20130248).

Before using this package, please make sure you have downloaded the necessary files from the online [Replication Package](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/114581/version/V1/view) on the AER website.


The package is made of 2 functions:

1. Table3Landais.cleandata() take as an argument a string of your path to the folder where you have stored the

Important Information:

Data
Need to modify slightly the data to be able to replicate perfectly since stata some round numbers have small digits while loading data round this. When the cut is using.

Code:
There are 7 variables in the table. 3 periods and 3 possible polynomial specifications.
In total 63 specifications are run. 
Then Select the lowest Aikake information (AIC).

Output:
The code produces a latex code that is to be pasted in a latex compiler to produce Table 3 of the paper
The code replicate exactly the results of the paper up to exceptions: 
1. We think the columns duratuiclaimed and duratuipaid are inverted in the paper. We systematically obtain the results of the other column while running the analysis regression on the other variable and the other way around.
2. The coefficient we obtain for age in the first period is -3.227 and not 0.227 as in the paper. We believ
